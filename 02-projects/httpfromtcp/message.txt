Command is the central point of the application. Each interaction that the application supports will be contained in a Command.
In the example above, 'server' is the command.
A flag is a way to modify the behavior of a command. Cobra supports fully POSIX-compliant flags as well as the Go flag package.
In the example above, 'port' is the flag.
Flag functionality is provided by the pflag library, a fork of the flag standard library which maintains the same interface while adding POSIX compliance.
