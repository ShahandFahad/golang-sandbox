Requirements

Sysinfo requires:

    Linux kernel 4.2 or later
    access to /sys & /proc Linux virtual file systems
    access to various files in /etc, /var, /run FS hierarchy
    superuser privileges (to access SMBIOS/DMI table and detect RAM size and properties)

Sysinfo doesn't require ANY other external utility on the target system, which is its primary strength, IMHO.

It depends on Linux internals heavily, so there are no plans to support other operating systems.



NOTE: EITHRE BUILT IN C++ or RUST
